# Predicting Eligibility for Social Welfare Schemes using Machine Learning

## üìú Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the allocation of *National Social Assistance Program (NSAP)* welfare schemes using *Machine Learning*.  
The NSAP program provides financial assistance to elderly, widows, and disabled individuals from below-poverty-line (BPL) households.  
Manual verification of applications is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays in delivering benefits.  
We developed a *multi-class classification ML model* to predict the most suitable NSAP scheme for applicants based on their demographic and socio-economic data.

## üéØ Objectives
- Automate eligibility classification for multiple NSAP schemes.
- Minimize human errors and reduce verification time.
- Build a scalable and deployable ML model to assist government welfare programs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Performance
| Metric          | Score   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Accuracy        | 99.04%  |
| Precision       | ~99%    |
| Recall          | ~99%    |

- High accuracy and balanced precision/recall indicate strong model performance.
- Key predictive features: Aadhaar availability, gender distribution, caste category.
